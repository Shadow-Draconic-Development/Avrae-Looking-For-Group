<h1>Looking For Group Helper<img align="right" src="Data/image.png" width="100px"></h1>

Looking For Group allows players to more readily search for groups in various different settings, primarily with the intent to go on a quest. Ultimately, this also allows a level of convenience for staff members as it displays additional information about the characters involved. While it may not involve every little detail about the character (I would just recommend using vsheet from [Verbose Character Tools](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5f7385fe647bb0a416316d1d)), staff members can customize the details that they see about each character that LFGs. Here are the following settings you can edit:

- subclass
- thp
- img (Character portrait display)
- player (Player is mentioned)
- ac
- ins (Passive insight)
- inv (Passive investigation)
- perc (Passive Perception)
- spell_list
- spell_slot
- full_subclass
- color_lvl (Border color based upon character level)

See [Settings](https://github.com/Shadow-Draconic-Development/Avrae-Looking-For-Group-Helper/blob/main/Code/settings/settings.md) for more details.
